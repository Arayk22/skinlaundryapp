# EDA

```{python}
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv(r'C:\Users\austi\OneDrive\Documents\Interviews\Skin Laundry\Clinic Product Sales Data.csv') 
```


Lets take a look at the first couple of observations!

```{python}
#Set the display up so we can see all of the columns
pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)
print(data.head())
```
Right away, some of the columns that don't seem to be needed are "guest user id,
product category, and clinic area. Lets check the unique values of product category to make
sure we can drop it

```{python}
print(data['product category'].unique())
```
"Serum" is the only value for the category, so we are good to drop this column
as it provides no info for us

Lets drop the columns we stated above

```{python}
data = data.drop(columns=['clinic area','guest user id','product category'])
print(data.head())
```

Next I am going to subset the data down to info that Skin Laundry as specified

```{python}
subset_data = data[(data['clinic name'] == 'Clinic G') & (data['product name'] == 'Hyaluronic Acid Serum')]
print(subset_data.head())

```

Next I am going to make sure the our variables are of correct type. Any
variables that are not of the correct type, I will correct accordingly.

```{python}
print(subset_data.info())
```
I am going to change the "sale date" column to a datetime data type

```{python}
subset_data.loc[:, 'sale date'] = pd.to_datetime(subset_data['sale date'])
```
