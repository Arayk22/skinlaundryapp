# Summary

In this analysis, a demand forecasting model was developed for Hyaluronic Acid 
serum at Clinic G for Q3 of 2024 (Julyâ€“September). Using an ARIMA model with a 
point intervention, the model achieved a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.4, 
indicating a strong prediction accuracy. This performance provides the clinic 
with a reliable forecast, helping ensure that inventory is adequately stocked 
to meet customer demand and reduce the risk of out-of-stock situations during 
this period.



Key Findings and Insights:

Demand Forecasting Accuracy: The ARIMA model's MAE of 1.4 suggests that the
forecast is precise and can be trusted to guide inventory planning and ordering 
decisions for Hyaluronic Acid serum. This will be critical for ensuring that
Clinic G can maintain stock levels that align with anticipated demand, thus 
avoiding overstocking or stockouts and optimizing warehouse operations.

Promotions and Sales Patterns: 
An important insight was discovered when plotting the historical sales data 
alongside promotional periods. The data revealed that certain promotions 
influence product sales, while others do not. Specifically:

Promotions with impact on sales:
-> 30% off all products
-> 30% off product
-> Buy 2 Get Cleanser free
These promotions caused substantial spikes in sales, suggesting that Clinic G 
can strategically use these promotions to boost demand and drive sales for 
the Hyaluronic Acid serum.

Promotions with minimal impact:
-> Spend more Save more
-> Buy 3 Get 1 free
-> 10% off serums
These promotions did not produce noticeable increases in sales, indicating that
they might not be as effective for this particular product.



Business Implications:

Inventory Management: With the forecasted demand in hand and an understanding 
of the promotional impact, Clinic G can optimize their ordering and stock 
levels. This ensures that the clinic is not overstocked during periods of low 
demand or understocked during promotional spikes, which is essential for 
maintaining customer satisfaction and maximizing sales.

Promotion Strategy: The insights into promotional effectiveness offer valuable 
guidance for Clinic G's future marketing strategies. By focusing on promotions 
that have historically proven successful, such as the "30% off all products" or
"Buy 2 Get Cleanser free," Clinic G can more effectively drive sales of the
Hyaluronic Acid serum and achieve better return on investment from their 
marketing efforts. Additionally, reducing reliance on less effective promotions 
can help save resources and improve marketing efficiency.

Forecast Accuracy for Planning: The ARIMA model's accuracy in predicting the 
demand for Q3 2024 can serve as a reliable basis for other product demand 
forecasts. If the clinic utilizes similar forecasting techniques across other 
products, it will help to streamline their overall inventory management and 
improve operational efficiency.


Conclusion:
The demand forecasting model provides valuable insight into the future sales of
Hyaluronic Acid serum at Clinic G, ensuring that inventory planning is accurate
and efficient. By strategically aligning promotional efforts with the most 
impactful offers, Clinic G can boost sales and avoid unnecessary stockouts. 
Overall, these insights will help optimize the clinic's operations, improve 
customer satisfaction, and drive growth in the coming quarter.
